"""Testing module for api predictions. This is a test file designed to use
pytest and prepared for some basic assertions and to add your own tests.

You can add new tests using the following structure:
```py
def test_{description for the test}(metadata):
    # Add your assertions inside the test function
    assert {statement_1 that returns true or false}
    assert {statement_2 that returns true or false}
```
The conftest.py module in the same directory includes the fixture to return
to your tests inside the argument variable `metadata` the value generated by
your function defined at `api.get_metadata`.

If your file grows in complexity, you can split it into multiple files in
the same folder. However, remember to add the prefix `test_` to the file.
